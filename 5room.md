# 5 Room Dungeon Generator
What do we need to design a 5-Room Dungeon?

__Global__:(for the complete dungeon):
- Theme
- Level of the dungeon

__Rooms__:
- Entrance/Guardian
- Puzzle/Roleplaying
- Fight/Setback
- Big Climax
- Reward/Revelation

## Theme
The theme of the dungeon will determine the styling of the dungeon, and the monsters.

### Entrance _or_ Guardian
In this room the party faces either a powerful guardian, or another reason why the dungeon has not been plundered.

### Puzzle _or_ Roleplaying
Depending on the theme, we give a puzzle or a roleplaying challenge to the party.

### Fight _or_ Setback
Deplete the resources of the party in some way before the final fight. Usually a small combat.

### Big Climax
Fighting the BBEG, should be in a cool battlemap.

### Reward _or_ Revelation
A surprise reward or twist at the end of the dungeon
